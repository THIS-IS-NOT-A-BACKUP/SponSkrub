# SponSkrub

This is a fork of [sponskrub](https://github.com/faissaloo/SponSkrub) primarily intended for use with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/pukkandan/yt-dlp)

## Main Changes

* Provide windows binary (only x86 for now)
* All sections are included by default and all switches are changed to `--exclude-`
* Removed `youtube-dl-sponskrub` since [yt-dlp](https://github.com/pukkandan/yt-dlp) has direct [sponskrub integraion](https://github.com/pukkandan/yt-dlp#sponSkrub-options-sponsorblock)

**PS**: I am not familar enough in DLang to add features or resolve issues (unless the issue is specific to this fork). It is probably better to make the request in [faissaloo/sponskrub](https://github.com/faissaloo/SponSkrub). I will merge any commits made there into this fork.

## Description
SponSkrub is a command line utility for removing sponsors from downloaded Youtube videos.

FFmpeg and FFprobe are required for this application to work. Additionally, `libcurl.dll` is necessary for windows. A copy of libcurl x86 is provided along with the releases.

It makes use of the [SponsorBlock API](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlockServer#api-docs) and I'd recommend installing the extension and maybe contributing some sponsorship times when you're ever bored.

You can build `sponskrub` by running `dub build`.
